# Coursera-TensorFlow-Specialization

TensorFlow In Practice Specialization introduces some very basic TF techniques. One of the key benefits is that we can accumulate good helper functions and good ML engineering/coding practice that can be useful for future data science work!

For TensorFlow Data and Deploy Specialization, I'd like to explore how to build a deep learning system (instead of jupyter notebook experiments) from scratch!
